# Kiva Portfolio Details of Mawuli
As an Impact Investor, I granted 0% interest loans through the Kiva.org lending platform to over 1,000 mom-and-pop businesses (80% run by women) in 47 countries. My portfolio, over 100 times larger than the average Kiva lender's portfolio, positioned me in the 99th percentile globally.

You may find my public lender profile available on the [kiva webiste](https://www.kiva.org/lender/mawueli)

## Why do I loan: 
Simple! We got to survive, y'all!
Every man got a right to decide his own destiny
And in this judgment there is no partiality.

How can you be sitting there, Telling me that you care?
When every time I look around, The people suffer in the suffering. 
In every way, in everywhere!
Some people got everything, Some people got nothing 
Some people got hopes and dreams, Some people got ways and means.
We got to survive, y'all!

## Who am I?
I grew up in the villages of Ghana, West Africa!
I love using technology to solve the problems I see in my communities.

As Software Engineer, I know for a fact that `In this age of technological inhumanity, It's a world that forces lifelong insecurity`. So I help out with 0% interest micro-business loans.
